# git-pioneer
An experimental tool to visualize git, but let's be honest, mostly to play around with portals. Built with threejs.
Currently developed mostly on OSX, but windows 10 development seems to work well.

## Setup
`npm i`

download the nw.js executable and place it in `git-pioneer/`

## Development
Development is done with budo, which will keep the client code hot-reloadable during edits.

You will need to run two commands in parallel:

`npm run webgl`

`npm run nwjs`
